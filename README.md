<p>One of my favourite hobbies is programming. I find lots of interest in making new projects and collaborating with others</p>
<p>I started programming in late-2023 and have had a strong connection ever sense.</p>

<h2>What Programming Languages I use</h2>

[![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-%23000000.svg?e&logo=rust&logoColor=white)](#) \
[![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-%23ED8B00.svg?logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)](#)

<p>Rust is my second language I picked up. I use rust in performance-critical situations. Rust's perspective of programming has changed how I write code in general.</p>
<p>I prefer Java as its syntax is clean and concise. The usage of Java in enterprise is also very attracting.</p>

<h2>The software I use day-to-day that I love!</h2>
